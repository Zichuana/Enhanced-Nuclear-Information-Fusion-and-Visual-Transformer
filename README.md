# Enhanced-Nuclear-Information-Fusion-and-Visual-Transformer

 The overall flow of the method. The framework consists of three main stages:   
 (1) Nuclear information acquisition, where the BreakHis dataset is processed by a segmentation model   
 (2) Enhanced dataset construction, where the segmented nuclei are refined via scale-adjusted fusion and   
 (3) Classification task implementation, where the enhanced data is.
